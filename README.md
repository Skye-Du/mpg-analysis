# mpg-analysis
This project focus on the predictions for mpg on Auto dataset from ISLR.
In this project, I used LDA, QDA, Logistic regression and knn to do the prediction on mpg01 (mpg01 = 1 if mpg>25; mpg01 = 0 otherwise). By comparing the models' performances, concluded the data distribution features.
